## TrainYourOwnYOLO

This repo let's you train a custom image detector using the state-of-the-art YOLOv3 computer vision algorithm.This repo works with TensorFlow 2.3 and Keras 2.4.

## To build and test your YOLO object detection algorithm follow the below steps:

### Image Annotation
1. Install Microsoft's Visual Object Tagging Tool (VoTT)
2. Annotate images
### Training
1. Download pre-trained weights
2. Train your custom YOLO model on annotated images
### Inference
1. Detect objects in new images and videos
